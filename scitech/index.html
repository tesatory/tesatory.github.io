		Who are you, and what do you do?
	      </h3>
	      <p>
		My name's Jemima Kiss and I'm the head of the Guardian's technology editorial team. I'm based in London but live in rural Sussex, hence spending a lot of time on trains.
	      </p>
	      <h3>
		What hardware do you use?
	      </h3>
	      <p>
		I jump between devices and brands but at the moment am using an iPhone 6 Plus. It has replaced a tablet for me, especially at home on the sofa when I don't want to get a laptop out in the evenings. It took about 30 minutes to get used to the size and I can't imagine having a smaller phone again, unless it's some kind of supercool screenless voice command unit. I AM WAITING. Patiently.

		I also use a MacBook Air between home and work, and use an external second screen with it at work. It's a binny old HP screen we seem to have a lot of here.. and a third screen for good measure, which is one of our very creaky iMacs, though I only use that for monitoring our own site. So it looks like a three-screen set up, but actually not so impressive..
	      </p>
	      <h3>
		And what software?
	      </h3>
	      <p>
		I try and do as much in the cloud as possible because of the security. Joke.

		But actually I do, because I don't want to be shafted when I eventually leave my laptop on the train, which will happen. I use Chrome heavily, and then the usual - Twitter (I'm one of the rare few who prefers their own desktop client), then Slack (we love it) and the usual Notes and iCal etc. It was the world's biggest ballache syncing Google and Apple calendars and software, defeating even the kind but clueless guy at the Genius Bar, but I finally sussed it out.
	      </p>
	      <h3>
		What would be your dream setup?
	      </h3>
	      <p>
		5k retina. One day I can have two 5k screens, but I'd settle for two separate machines just so I could have the two screens. Dell does a 5k screen though, so that might do for the meantime..
